//You have 3 rods (letâ€™s call them A, B, and C) and n disks of different sizes.
//Initially, all disks are stacked in increasing size on rod A (largest at bottom).
//
//Goal: Move all disks from rod A to rod C using rod B as an auxiliary, following these rules:
//
//Only one disk can be moved at a time.
//
//A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
